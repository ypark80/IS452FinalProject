# Sudoku Game

This program asks the user for difficulty level of the game: easy, medium or hard.
Then, Sudoku puzzle is provided based on the level. If you click the screen after the puzzle is displayed, it will quit.
Then, it will ask if the users want to see the solution. If yes, it will show solution in a different color.
If no, it will show a image saying "See you soon". And, the program quits.
Further description for the codes and programs are available in the ypark80_FinalProject.py file in comments.
